Hello. I`m guide bot.
I want to tell you about this game.
As you noticed you can move by keys WASD.
You can move only on paths '#', ground '.'...
and doors '+'.
Let me explain what these words at the top mean.
HP means your health points,
Money means money (hard to understand),
Inv means inventory, where you can see your guns,
M means melee damage, R means range damage,
S means strength,
D means distance.
Ok, that`s all about top interface.
Also, you can find shops '$', where...
you can buy some heals and items.
Sometimes you can see '?' symbol, which means loot.
In conclusion, i want to say that...
you can meet freaks: Demented 'D' and...
Hunter 'H'.
Dementeds usually live in buildings,
Hunters in paths, but that doesn`t mean that...
you can`t meet them in different places,
it`s ok.
You can defeat them by your...
melee gun on 'e'...
or range gun on 'q'.
All your melee guns have distance 1 and...
you can hit freaks around you.
Your range gun also can hit freaks...
around you, but only on 1 distance.
If your enemy far away from you...
you have to stand so that you...
can hit it in vertical or...
horizontal direction.
Good luck!
